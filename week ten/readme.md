# week ten :-) 

Based on the feedback from Karen i spent the majority of this week trying to figure out p5.js, how to host on github and experimenting with different ways to simulate the collaborative destruction on the webpage. I think my main conclusion for this week is that Daniel Shiffman deserves a medal for his contributions to this project and humanity (!) Building on kinetic typography I experimented a lot this week with the wave functions and came up with some pretty whacky stuff see below final version:
