SLIDE 1 

So through my presentation I’m going to explain my line inquiry which focuses on temporary art in the context of the digital landscape. This includes the what and why, artists that inspired my project and alternative outcomes to my final pitch. 

SLIDE 2 

Impermanence has been a well explored idea within art for centuries, one that has been investigated in a multitude of ways, whether it be conceptually through the artists’ convictions on existence. Or even in fact literally, such as through the materials used in the artworks themselves. 

Dieter Roth, for example, was an artist who purposely chose to use organic materials to explore the visibility of time, he in fact welcomed the inevitable decomposition of his works. 

SLIDE 3 

Another example of work that uses organic materials is Comedian, by Maurizio Cattelan that sold for $120,000 last year. In this case, whoever purchased the piece didn’t actually buy the work itself - it’s a banana. It’s going to rot. Essentially what they purchased was the idea, rather than the object. When they replace it it will still be considered a Cattelan. I think it creates a really interesting conversation on what art is and the absurdity of it. For as Warhol once said “Art is whatever you can get away with.” 

SLIDE 4 

My biggest influence for this project was Keith Haring’s 1980-1985 Subway Drawings. During this five year period Haring produced over 5000 chalk-drawings in the New York subway. Haring described the power of these pieces was to simply exist, in their fragility, in the middle of all the power and tension that was the New York subway system. On the project Haring is quoted: “The context of where you do something is going to have an effect. The subway drawings were, as much as they were drawings, performances.” 

SLIDE 5 

What all these examples have in common is that the artworks degraded over time, however, as every dull cyber security seminar in high-school reminded us, the internet is forever, an anomaly in a world determined to decay.  

As Haring said, where you do something is going to have an effect. And for my project, to create something that is temporary in the context of the permanent, digital landscape opens up a potential dialogue on the transient nature of most things in life. 


SLIDE 6 

My pitch is to create a digital exhibition that degenerates, not over time, but by how many people interact with it. The best way to describe it would be collaborative destruction, for every person that interacts with the work the more it decays until it is completely distorted, and a new art work is generated in its place. 


SLIDE 7 

Pictured here is a very rough mock up of what the exhibition might look like in the beginning when very view people have had the opportunity to view it. How many people it would take for the painting to become completely indecipherable is something that I think would have to be user tested and dependent on how many people might potentially interact with the project. Both so that everyone has an opportunity to see the artwork semi complete but also allow people to follow the process of its distortion. 

SLIDE 8

And Here are some rough sketches of how the artwork might look at different levels of distortion. 

On the previous side the piece pictured was an untitled 1983 painting by Keith Haring. I think for the final project it would be great to get a small catalogue of local artists that might be interested in being involved. So having access to high resolution scanned copies of their artwork would be essential to its success. 

SLIDE 9 
The software I’d need to complete this generative design project would definitely include the Adobe creative suite. 

I think learning HTML, CSS, and Java would be essential to accomplishing this project but I’m not one hundred percent sure to what capacity as I couldn’t find anything similar to this currently being done. 

Creating a website that responds to how many people have interacted with it would also definitely require some level of fluency in the aforementioned coding languages. 

SLIDE 10 

Alternative outputs could include a live feed of someone or a machine destroying artwork based on an outside factor. This would strongly be referencing Jonathan Fletcher Moore’s “artificial killing machine” discussed in class in which he has suspended dozens of toy guns that fire, with every real world drone death. 

Some of my alternative lines of inquiry to this project focused on social media mining, specifically twitter data. Using python it is possible to create an algorithm that interprets the sentiment of someone’s tweet, giving it a score out of 0-100. I think it would also be interesting to make or unmake something based on this data.
