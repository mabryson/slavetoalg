# WEEK ONE 
Week One saw us introduced to the course and the world of generative design. Defined by wikipedia as: "an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints" the merit of generative design, as a field, is hotly contested.  The sum of my preliminary research could be described as a series of of extreme, and vastly varied opinions - every article either describing it as redundant or the future of design. 

## IN CLASS ACTIVITY: ROLL THE DICE

This activity produced an array of interesting outputs and I enjoyed the randomness that it lended itself too. For my iteration I chose to make a fruit salad, the first roll being which fruit, the second what colour to fill it in, and the third being the outline. I think it would be great to produce large scale artpieces in this manner.
