# week seven 
Week seven we were introduced to pseudo code, had a quick rundown of everyones projects and ended with a fun processing workshop. It was really interesting to see how everyone's projects are developing. I spent most of the week creating mock ups of what I wanted my project to look like:

consults this week was really confronting, I didn't realise the limitations of processing visually - at least in the sense of a project I wanted to create


## pseudo code 

"GALLERY" 

INPUT: people 

IF people + 1 
   THEN run next frame of animation 
   ELSE animation remain the same 
END IF
