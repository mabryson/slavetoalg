# week nine - milestone 
This week we had a milestone presentation of our projects and received feedback on the progress of our work! Feedback from Karen was fair and highlighted a number of areas in my project that needed development, I wasn't actually aware that you couldn't upload processing sketches to the web so had been working in that format when I really should of been working in p5.js woo very fun piece of info I can tell you that much for free ! I presented my kinetic type that I had been working on which was an avenue I was exploring in how I could simulate the deconstruction of the exhibition
