# WEEK TWO 
Week two was our first proper introduction into processing. The program is very intuitive and it was great to get a rundown on the fundamentals in class. I had explored it a bit prior but nothing more than fiddling around with other people's sketches so it was great to create my own for the first time :-) Here's a video of me messing around with one of our first sketches <vid> 
## IN CLASS ACTIVITY: SELF PORTRAITS 
I loved all the different self portraits that everyone came up with! Seeing how differently everyone takes a 'brief' is the best part of studio and its great that sharing our work is something that still can be done remotely. See my sketch below (the "arms" followed the mouse coordinates):
