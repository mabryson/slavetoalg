## IN CLASS ACTIVITY: BIO TECHNOLOGICAL DRAWINGS 
away from computers today - asked to create non human drawing machine from what's around us --> Not a completely original idea as what first came to mind for me was an installation at MONA where hundreds of pencils are atttached to the leaves of a tree which draw onto a piece of paper on the ground. With no access to a 150 year old willow tree I attached a clamp to a tripod and tied a string with a pen on its end and set it up outside to do its thing for 1/2 an hour see results:

## ASSIGNMENT IDEAS 
1. Twiter data mining
2. How is Kanye? algorithm deduces the sentiment of Kanye's tweets for the day and gives them a score from 0 - 100, <50 being positive and >50 being negative. this updates website that has a picture of kanye either smiling or frowning based on the sentiments of his tweet for that day 
- how to achieve this?
