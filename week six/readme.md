# *week 6*
Week six we classified our projects into broad groupings. These groupings led to really interesting discussions on our own projects, some suggestions from my peers included: 
* click to take a screenshot, every patron of the website leaving their mark 
* expanding on the original idea: the want to see beauty is what destroys it in the end. 
* Screen gradually turns white (pixels)
