# *week 6*
Week six we classified our projects into broad groupings. These groupings led to really interesting discussions on our own projects, some suggestions from my peers included: 
* click to take a screenshot, every patron of the website leaving their mark 
* expanding on the original idea: **the want to see beauty is what destroys it in the end.** IE cutting flowers, taking seashells as momentos leading to erosion, instagram tourism destroying fragile ecosystems  
* Screen gradually turns white (pixels) 

#### I feel like this discussion really help develop on my original proposal, I was finding it hard to articulate a meaning behind my project and its digital decay but I feel like is concept of fragile ecosystems is something that i want to explore further.
