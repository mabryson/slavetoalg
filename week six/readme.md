# *week 6*
Week six we classified our projects into broad groupings. These groupings led to really interesting discussions on our own projects, some suggestions from my peers included: 
* click to take a screenshot, every patron of the website leaving their mark 
* expanding on the original idea: **the want to see beauty is what destroys it in the end.** IE cutting flowers, taking seashells as momentos leading to erosion, instagram tourism destroying fragile ecosystems  
* Screen gradually turns white (pixels) *

I feel like this discussion really help develop on my original proposal, I was finding it hard to articulate a meaning behind my project and its digital decay but I feel like is concept of fragile ecosystems, over exploitation, and this modern desire to consume beauty in the digital age is something that i want to explore further. 

## rapid prototyping 
Comes from UX design and coding; used to ideate/generate a concept that will become a digital project but to do it only with pen, paper, and scissors. Paper prototype leads to pseudo-code, which leads to actual code. In groups we created our own paper prototypes of old arcade games - space invaders instantly came to mind.
